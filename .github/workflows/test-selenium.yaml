####
# We need to run these as docker images:
#  UAA
#  RabbitMQ
#  Selenium Tests (maybe these ones could run in the host machine)
#  Selenium Hub (which runs the browser in silent mode)

# The workflow is more or less like this:
# job:build-rabbitmq-image  -> job:build-test-runner-image -> job:run-tests

# job:build-rabbitmq-image : Ideally, we do not want to push it. can we do that in github actions?
#
# job:run-tests : It runs within a container and it uses these services:
#  - rabbitmq
#  - UAA
#  - selenium-hub
# and it has this step which uses the image test-runner built by the job build-test-runner-image
